# Quora Question Pair Similarity
This project is aimed at detecting duplicate questions on the Quora platform using deep learning techniques. The goal is to reuse answers for new questions that match previous ones. The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains two variables for question pairs and an output indicating if the pair is similar.

The data was preprocessed and converted into a numeric form using Python and NumPy. Word embeddings were created using Global Vectors. Four different LSTM-based models were developed using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries. The best model achieved an accuracy of 79% in detecting duplicate questions.

This project showcases the use of NLP and text mining techniques in combination with deep learning for solving real-world problems. The techniques used in this project can be extended to other similar text-based problems.
